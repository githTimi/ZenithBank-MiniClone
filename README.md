# ZenithBank-MiniClone... This is an imitation of the zenith bank app , screenshot of the app is in zenith_images folder. the App contains 3 screens which i used to implement the 3 functonalities
of the original zenith bank app , which is the Overview Screen, the Transfer Screen and the Airtime screen.. the Overview screen contains the account details of the user such as the
name of the account , the account balance and the ledger balance , i created a global store with redux to share the account details throughout all the screens in the app.
the Transfer screen which is the major functionality of the zenith bank app, performs transfers the value of the transfer is then subtracted from the balance in the global store 
account balance and the new balance is then reflected in the main screen. the Airtime screen does the same function as the transfer screen...
the app uses drawer navigation and bottom tab navigation which both have custom styles..image of app in zenith_image folder.
